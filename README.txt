https://github.com/dmcki23/MultiplicativeECA

This program transforms additive elementary cellular automata into multiplicative automata via permutations and extends the standard binary operation to complex via four kinds of multiplication. It includes a GUI to explore solutions, support libraries to construct hypercomplex multiplication tables, a short paper, algorithm visualization diagrams, Javadoc documentation, allows for user input, and is designed to integrate well elsewhere.

The main algorithm is described in /Paper/paper.md
Secondary documentation is in /Paper/UserGuide.md, including the permuted Cayley-Dickson algorithm and the Swing panel functions
Javadoc code documentation is available
An appendix with a cross-section of solutions is available at www.danielmckinley.com
